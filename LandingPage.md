### **About the Navigator**  
In response to the challenges posed during the pandemic and feedback from our UC community, we recognized the need for a centralized, user-friendly resource platform. The Essential Needs Navigator:  
- **Aggregates Resources**: Automatically scrapes updated information from official UC websites and trusted external resources.  
- **AI-Powered**: Built on GPT to provide dynamic, query-based answers tailored to student needs.  
- **Cross-Campus Support**: Offers resources across UC campuses to assist students wherever they are.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensures that all information‚Äîfood resources, housing, financial aid, healthcare, and more‚Äîremains accurate and relevant.
